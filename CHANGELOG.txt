jsonlog 1.x, 2017-05-12
-----------------------
- Most of the logic moved to event class, to be dependency injected via
  JsonLog's constructor.
- All log properties split into site/request/event specific columns.
- Every column has (must have) a same-named getter.
- Removed '@version' property; seems to be something only logstash uses or sets.
- Added 'host' property.
- Renamed 'level' property; from 'severity'.

jsonlog 1.x, 2017-05-07
-----------------------
- Vs. Drupal 7 jsonlog: -uid, +useragent; canonical, tags not set when empty.
