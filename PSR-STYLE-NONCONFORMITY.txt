PSR CODING STANDARD/STYLE GUIDE NONCONFORMITY NOTICE
----------------------------------------------------
This library deviates from PSR codings standards/style guides by these aspects:
- indentation is 2 spaces
- class/method opening braces goes on same line
- secondary control structures (else) goes on next line
- 80 line limit is only respected for comments, not code
- 120 line limit is attempted for code, however not enforced rigorously
- type keywords are long form, except when line limit dictates otherwise
- switch may contain obsolete break, to prevent error upon code refactoring
